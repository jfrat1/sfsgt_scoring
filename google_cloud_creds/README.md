# Google Cloud Credentials

This folder should hold a valid credentials JSON file for the SFSGT service
account associated with the SFSGT google cloud project. All files in this folder
which end in .json are intentionally ignored by Git to prevent publishing sensitive
credential information.

The credential file required for this process was created by following the instructions
at this link: https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#create_credentials_for_a_service_account
