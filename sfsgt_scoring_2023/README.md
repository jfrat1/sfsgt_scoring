# SFSGT Scoring Application from 2023

NOTE: This code is old and no longer used in the updated app. It is here for reference only.

This directory is a copy of the source code which was used in
in 2023 to execute the season scoring app. I copied it here so
that I could reference it while re-building the project to be
more modular, which will enable me to make modifications more
easily in the future. As with any project, the requirements change
slightly each year. Breaking the app up into smaller modular
chunks will help me keep up without pulling my hair out.
